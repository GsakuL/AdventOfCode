# My AdventOfCode solutions

## Disclaimer
- this uses Python 3
- look at your own risk! I'm not responsible, if you spoil yourself
- some days are an unorganized mess, but thats not important here/now
- the last day of each year may be faulty/unfinished/wrong
    - i may generate the template for each day in advance, in this case, obviously the last "non-template"-day may be subject to errors
- I may change the structure, if I want to try other languages.
- unless stated otherwise, all of the solutions are without help specific to AoC
    - meaning, I have not looked at hints/other solutions on e.g. Reddit
    - though I may have looked up some "basic" things about the given language
    - ... or some generic stuff like algos
- I want to try to stick to standard libs, to keep it simple

## How to use
1. either 
    - put your AoC session cookie in `aoc_components/_session_cookie.txt`, if you want auto download (may change in the future)
    - ...or put the puzzle input(s) at `<year>/input/<day, with 1 leading zero if single digit>.txt` 
2. `requirements.txt` is not used for all days, but should contain working deps
3. run the day you want
